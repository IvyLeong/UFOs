# UFOs#Challenge--The purpose of this project is to add some filter functions on the web page. We need to use javascript to import data using d3. We need to clear existing data on html file first and start to loop through the data. The data were appended and added as each table cells. Next, we create a function that can grab the datetime, city, state, country and shape value using the “if” statements. Finally, a function of building the filtered table is created. On html file, several labels and input boxes are needed to create for the user to input the filters. A filtered button is also created for clicking for filtered actions.
